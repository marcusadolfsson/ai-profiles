## Landing page

The marketing landing page lives in [`apps/landing/`](apps/landing/README.md) (Astro + Tailwind, deployed to Vercel).

## Install

### Download

Download the latest `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/bartekczyz/ai-profiles/releases/latest). Open it, drag `ai-profiles.app` to `/Applications`. Launch.

### Build from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bartekczyz/ai-profiles.git
cd ai-profiles
pnpm install
pnpm --filter ai-profiles tauri build
```

The `.dmg` lands in `apps/ai-profiles/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/dmg/`. macOS will warn on first launch because the local build isn't notarized — right-click the `.app` → Open → Open to bypass Gatekeeper.

## Supported apps

| App | Desktop launcher | CLI wrapper | Auth isolation |
|-----|-----------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Claude** (Desktop + Claude Code CLI) | `Claude (<Name>).app` | `claude-<slug>` (sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`) | macOS Keychain entry derived from config dir |
| **ChatGPT** (Desktop) + **Codex** (CLI) | `ChatGPT (<Name>).app` | `codex-<slug>` (sets `CODEX_HOME`) | plain `auth.json` inside profile's `CODEX_HOME` — isolation is automatic |

## Using ai-profiles

Create a profile from the sidebar — choose an app (Claude or ChatGPT), give it a name, pick a colour, and choose which surfaces you want (desktop app, CLI, or both). The app generates everything you need on the spot:

- **Desktop app.** A `Claude (<Name>).app` or `ChatGPT (<Name>).app` launcher lands in `/Applications`. Double-click to open the app with that profile's account, history, and settings. Spotlight, Launchpad, Finder, and ⌘-Tab all see it as its own app, tinted with the profile colour.
- **CLI.** A `claude-<slug>` or `codex-<slug>` command appears on your `PATH`. Run it in any terminal to start the CLI with that profile's config and login. Each profile keeps its own session and credentials.

Switch profiles from the sidebar, with ⌘1..⌘9 to jump to a slot, ⌘F to filter the list, or ⌘K to open the command palette. ⌘N creates a new profile, ⌘, opens Settings.

Already using Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or ChatGPT/Codex? On first launch the app offers to import your existing setup into your first profile. You can rerun this later from Settings → Data → "Detect and import…".

Deleting a profile from its detail view removes the launcher and CLI wrapper; the profile's data either goes to the Trash or is deleted outright, your choice.

### What profiles share

Profiles separate your **account**, not your working setup. Skills, subagents, slash commands and your global instructions are inert content describing how you work, so a new profile inherits them from your main install (`~/.claude` or `~/.codex`) instead of starting empty:

| Inherited from your main install | Kept separate per profile |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `skills/`, `agents/`, `commands/`, `rules/`, `workflows/`, `output-styles/` | account and credentials (Keychain entry / `auth.json`) |
| `CLAUDE.md` for Claude, `AGENTS.md` for Codex — your global instructions | `settings.json`, including `hooks` and `permissions` |
| | `plugins/`, MCP servers, session and project history |

Anything executable or credentialed stays isolated: a hook you add for one account can't fire inside another, and a permissive tool allowlist can't leak into a work profile.

The inherited entries are symlinks, written into the profile's config dir when its CLI wrapper is generated. They are only ever created over an empty path, so a profile can opt out — give it a real directory and it keeps its own copy from then on:

```sh
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/ai-profiles/profiles/<id>/cli-config
rm skills && mkdir skills
```

Profiles created by migrating an existing install already hold their own copy of everything, so they inherit nothing.

### Usage stats

Each profile's detail page shows that profile's current quota utilization alongside the launcher and CLI buttons. A small countdown tells you when the next auto-refresh will fire (every 5 minutes while the card is visible), or you can hit the ↻ button to refresh on demand.

**Claude profiles** show three meters: the rolling 5-hour window, the 7-day window, and the 7-day Sonnet sub-window. Under the hood the card calls Anthropic's `/api/oauth/usage` endpoint using the profile's own OAuth token, read from the macOS Keychain entry Claude Code created when you signed in. The quota endpoint and the Keychain naming convention are undocumented Anthropic internals — if either changes, the meters may show `—` until we ship a patch.

**Codex profiles** show two meters: the 5-hour window and the weekly window. The card drives `codex app-server` over its JSON-RPC protocol (`account/rateLimits/read`) — no separate auth is needed because the app-server reads from the profile's own `CODEX_HOME/auth.json` directly.

## Sessions

A Claude profile's page lists its sessions, from the CLI and from the desktop app's Code tab alike: title, folder, when it was last used, and whether it's open right now.

- **Move** a session to another profile. Everything that belongs to it goes: the transcript, subagents, file history, todos and the plan it follows.
  - It also lands in the destination's desktop app, which lists it from then on.
  - Anything it replaces is backed up first.
- **Project memory** is merged, not overwritten.
  - A note only one profile changed since the last move merges by itself.
  - A note both changed is yours to decide: keep the newer, take either side, or a merge Claude writes (no tools, safe mode) that you read before using.
- **Afterwards**, the copy left behind can be archived (compressed, and restorable), deleted once the moved copy checks out identical, or kept.
- **Archive** a session to take it out of the list, then **restore** it, or delete the archive for good.

The dialog shows each step as it runs, and quits a desktop app for you when it holds the session open.

## Remote hosts

Claude Code accounts on a Linux machine, one `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` each, show up in the sidebar as profiles under the machine's name. Their sessions run in tmux with Remote Control on, so they keep going with nothing attached and follow you to the Claude app on your phone.

</p>

From the Mac you can:

- **Start, resume, stop and restart** sessions, and rename them. The name follows the session to Remote Control and tmux.
- **See and answer a session's window** from inside ai-profiles, when it's waiting on a question. You can also attach to it in Terminal over ssh.
- **Move a session to another account** on the host, with the same memory merge as on this Mac.
- **Archive, restore and delete archives.** Archives are compressed; a 300 MB transcript keeps in about 100.
- **Add an account and sign it in** from here (the sign-in link opens on the Mac). You can also sign an account out, rename it, give it a color and ⌘-number, or delete it.
- **Open a Remote Control session** in the Claude app of the matching profile on this Mac.

### Setting up a host

The machine needs **tmux 3.0 or newer** and **Claude Code**. The server is a single static binary for x86_64 or arm64 Linux, attached to every [release](https://github.com/bartekczyz/ai-profiles/releases/latest):

```sh
sudo apt install tmux
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin && curl -fsSL https://github.com/bartekczyz/ai-profiles/releases/latest/download/ai-profiles-server-$(uname -m)-linux -o ~/.local/bin/ai-profiles-server && chmod +x ~/.local/bin/ai-profiles-server
ai-profiles-server setup
```

Or build it from source, with a Rust toolchain ([rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs)):
`cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/bartekczyz/ai-profiles ai-profiles-server`.

`setup` walks through it step by step:

1. It checks tmux and Claude Code, and finds your accounts under `~/.claude-accounts/`.
2. It asks which networks may connect. Tailscale and WireGuard peers can by default; a LAN only if you say so.
3. It installs a systemd user service that survives a reboot.
4. It prints a pairing code. Paste that into ai-profiles under **Settings → Remote hosts → Pair a host**.

The same steps are in the app, under **How to set up a host**. Later, `ai-profiles-server doctor` checks the install, and `ai-profiles-server pair` makes a new code.

  <img alt="Settings, Remote hosts, with the setup guide" src="docs/screenshots/remote-setup-guide.png" width="720">
</p>

### How it connects

- **Transport:** the server speaks HTTPS (TLS 1.3) with its own certificate. The pairing code carries the certificate's fingerprint, and the Mac trusts that certificate and no other.
- **Pairing and tokens:** each code works once, for 10 minutes. The token it's exchanged for lives in the Keychain; the server keeps only its hash, and `ai-profiles-server revoke` cuts a Mac off.
- **Who can connect:** only addresses you allow, by default Tailscale, WireGuard and the machine itself. Everyone else is dropped before TLS.
- **Running commands:** the server starts `claude` and tmux with argument lists, never through a shell. It reads and types only into windows it opened, and starts new sessions only in the folders it's told it may use.

## Onboarding

**First launch.** A welcome dialog appears once; after that you land on the empty state with a single "+ New profile" CTA. There is no auto-prompt — the next step is on you.

**Creating your first profile when you already have Claude or ChatGPT/Codex installed.** Clicking "+ New profile" opens a fork dialog with two paths:

- **Just add a new profile, keep existing install as-is** (default — press Enter). Leaves your existing install untouched. `claude` or `codex` keeps working with your current account. The new profile is fully separate and accessed via `claude-<slug>` or `codex-<slug>`.
- **Migrate existing install into a profile.** Adopts your existing `~/.claude` (and `~/Library/Application Support/Claude` if Claude Desktop is installed), or `~/.codex` (and `~/Library/Application Support/Codex` if the ChatGPT desktop app is installed), as your first profile. See "What migrate does" below.

### What migrate does

Three steps, in order:

1. **Copies** your existing data into the new profile dir under `~/Library/Application Support/ai-profiles/profiles/<id>/`. Symlinks stay symlinks, with relative targets re-pointed so they still resolve once the originals move in step 2 — skill managers routinely install links that reach outside `~/.claude`.
2. **Moves** the originals (`~/.claude` and/or `~/Library/Application Support/Claude` for Claude; `~/.codex` and/or `~/Library/Application Support/Codex` for Codex) into a timestamped backup dir under `~/Library/Application Support/ai-profiles/migration-backup-<timestamp>/`.
3. **Generates** the per-profile launcher (`Claude (<Name>).app` or `ChatGPT (<Name>).app`) and CLI wrapper (`claude-<slug>` or `codex-<slug>` in `~/.local/bin`).

### After migrating

- Use `claude-<slug>` instead of `claude` (or `codex-<slug>` instead of `codex`) to reach your old account. The wrapper sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (Claude) or `CODEX_HOME` (Codex) to the profile dir.
- The plain `claude` or `codex` command still works, but with no `~/.claude` / `~/.codex` present it'll start a fresh install dir on next invocation. It's not broken — it just sees an empty config.
- **Claude profiles:** you'll be prompted to log in once. macOS Keychain service names are derived from `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, so credentials don't carry across.
- **Codex profiles:** auth is stored in `auth.json` inside `CODEX_HOME`, so a `codex login` re-run in the new profile dir is all that's needed.
- Settings, history, MCP config, and project memory all come with the migration.

### Reverting a migration

Backups stay on disk for 7 days, then auto-delete. To roll back manually before then:

For a Claude migration:
```sh
# 1. Delete the profile from ai-profiles (Trash or keep, your choice).
# 2. Restore the originals from the backup dir:
mv ~/Library/Application\ Support/ai-profiles/migration-backup-<timestamp>/.claude ~/.claude
mv ~/Library/Application\ Support/ai-profiles/migration-backup-<timestamp>/Claude ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude
# 3. Open Claude. It'll see your old config again.
```

For a Codex migration:
```sh
# 1. Delete the profile from ai-profiles (Trash or keep, your choice).
# 2. Restore the originals from the backup dir:
mv ~/Library/Application\ Support/ai-profiles/migration-backup-<timestamp>/.codex ~/.codex
mv ~/Library/Application\ Support/ai-profiles/migration-backup-<timestamp>/Codex ~/Library/Application\ Support/Codex
# 3. Open ChatGPT. It'll see your old config again.
```

### Triggering migration later

If you picked "just add a new profile" but later change your mind, open **Settings → Data → Re-import…** (or press ⌘I). The same migration flow runs.

### Resetting onboarding

**Settings → Reset onboarding flags** shows the welcome dialog (and the fork dialog) again on next launch. It does not touch profiles, backups, or your theme.

## FAQ

**Why do I have to log in to Claude Code again after importing my existing install?**
The Keychain service name is derived from your `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, which changes when you move into a per-profile directory. The credentials don't carry over. You only need to log in once per profile.

**Why does the Dock show Claude's regular icon instead of my profile's color?**
The launcher `.app` immediately execs the real Claude.app, so the running Dock icon belongs to Claude. The custom color shows up in Spotlight, Finder, Launchpad, and Cmd-Tab — anywhere the launcher itself is referenced. We're tracking better Dock-icon options for v1.1.

**My new profile launcher doesn't open as `claude-<slug>` from my terminal.**
`~/.local/bin` isn't on your PATH. Open Settings → System and click "Install / re-install hook", or add the line manually to your `.zshrc` / `.bashrc` / `config.fish`. Open a new terminal to pick up the change.

**I installed a new skill and my profile's CLI doesn't see it.**
Profiles link to the skills in your main install, so anything you install there shows up in every profile with no extra step. If a profile sees *no* inherited skills at all, its links haven't been written yet — they're created whenever the profile's CLI wrapper is generated, so editing the profile (changing its colour, say) will produce them. Profiles that migrated an existing install keep their own copy and inherit nothing by design.

**I put an `AGENTS.md` in my Claude config dir and nothing happened.**
Claude Code reads `AGENTS.md` at project scope only; its user-scope instructions file is `CLAUDE.md`. Codex is the other way round and reads `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`. That's why the table above names a different file per app.

**Does this send any of my data anywhere?**
No. The app is local-only and has no analytics, no telemetry, no remote logging. Auto-update checks the GitHub Releases manifest and that's the only outbound request.

**Can I migrate later if I skipped the first-run prompt?**
Yes — Settings → Data → "Detect and import…".

**Is this safe? What about my credentials?**
Each Claude profile gets a separate Keychain entry derived from its config directory. We don't read or copy your credentials; Claude Code handles all of that. The CLI isolation behavior depends on undocumented Claude Code internals (its SHA-256 service-name derivation), and could break in a future Claude Code release. If it does we'll patch.

Codex profiles store credentials in a plain `auth.json` inside each profile's `CODEX_HOME` directory. Isolation is automatic — there is no Keychain involvement.

**The usage meters on the profile detail page show `—` instead of numbers — what's wrong?**
For Claude profiles, the card calls Anthropic's `/api/oauth/usage` endpoint, which is undocumented and may change shape without notice. If the response stops matching what we parse, the affected meters render as `—` rather than crashing. Note that the first refresh after a fresh install triggers a macOS Keychain access prompt — click "Always Allow" so it doesn't recur.

For Codex profiles, the card drives `codex app-server` over JSON-RPC. If the Codex CLI is not on your `PATH` or the JSON-RPC protocol changes, the meters will show `—`. File an issue and we'll patch.

**Why "Settings" instead of "Preferences"?**
macOS deprecated "Preferences" in favor of "Settings" in Ventura. We follow the current convention.
